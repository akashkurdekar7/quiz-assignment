# Quiz App

A fun and interactive quiz application built with React and Vite. Test your knowledge across various topics with timed quizzes, instant feedback on answers, and more!

## Live Demo

You can try out the quiz app by visiting the live version here:

[Quiz App Demo](https://quiz-assignment-delta.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Timed Quizzes**: Each quiz has a countdown timer for each question.
- **Instant Feedback**: After answering a question, users are instantly informed whether they were correct or incorrect.
- **Confetti Celebration**: A celebratory confetti effect when the user completes the quiz.
- **Track Scores**: Keeps track of your score throughout the quiz and shows your final score at the end.

## Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akashkurdekar7/quiz-assignment.git
   ```
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd quiz-assignment
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains all the source code for the app.

  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components like `Question`, `Quiz`, etc.
  - `assets/`: Holds static assets like images and icons.
  - `App.js`: The main entry point for the app.
  - `index.js`: The starting point for rendering the app in the DOM.

- `public/`: Public files that are served as-is, such as `index.html`.

## API Integration

The quiz data is fetched from an external API endpoint during the quiz session. The API used is `https://api.jsonserve.com`, which provides questions and answers.

**Note**: If you want to replace the API or host your own, change the `apiUrl` variable in the `Question.js` component.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Next-generation, fast build tool.
- **styled-components**: For styled-components based CSS-in-JS styling.
- **axios**: Promise-based HTTP client to fetch data from the API.
- **react-confetti**: For the confetti effect when the quiz is finished.
- **react-icons**: For various icons in the UI.

## Running Tests

Currently, there are no unit tests implemented, but you can add them with a testing library like Jest or React Testing Library.
