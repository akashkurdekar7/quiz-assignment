## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the project structure:

- `src/`: Contains the main code for the app.

  - `components/`: Reusable React components like `Question`, `Quiz`, etc.
  - `assets/`: Static assets, such as images and icons.
  - `App.js`: The entry point of the app.
  - `index.js`: Renders the app to the DOM.

- `public/`: Public files like `index.html`, served directly by the browser.

## API Integration

The quiz questions are pulled from an external API (`https://api.jsonserve.com`). If you wish to use a different API or host your own, simply update the `apiUrl` in the `Question.js` component.

## Technologies Used

This app was built using:

- **React** for building the user interface.
- **Vite** for a fast, modern build setup.
- **styled-components** for styling with CSS-in-JS.
- **axios** for making API calls.
- **react-confetti** for the fun confetti effect when the quiz is completed.
- **react-icons** for various icons in the UI.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
